      ABOUT
      </p>
      <p >

      Creator of facilango, Robin has over 10 years of experience helping people progress with languages. His interest in
      languages began with his own learning. He initially struggled to progress with real speaking ability. Eventually
      he realised that fast improvement is very possible and what elements are necessary to make it happen, and it's been
      fantastic to see many others achieve fluency and other great results.

      APPROACH
        </p>
        <p>
      Generally with the conventional language-learning approach, you get bombarded with vocab and grammar, long
      before you might actually use it. But using the language is a key part of the learning process. With this approach, using the language is the central axis that everything revolves around. You dip
      in and out of simple explainers and vocab as and when you need it. Using the language can involve reading, listening and
      most importantly speaking. The ideal language lesson in my opinion is like a gym-training session: a coach
      guides and prompts you and gives key info when necessary, but it's you who does the heavy lifting. Like going to the gym, you
      only improve by actually doing it (and reps!). The good news is that doing it is always more fun
      than being explained how to do it. And it really gets fun when you realise that you're getting better.

      <br />When you use it you will learn it.</i>
