        “I created <b>facilango</b> because I wanted to offer a language-tutor service with <b>a better approach</b>. When I began learning languages myself using conventional approaches, I struggled to progress. Eventually I discovered what elements make an ideal approach and that when in place, fast improvement is possible for anyone who wants it. Since the creation of facilango it’s been fantastic to see people make <b>tangible progress</b> - especially evident from their conversational ability - and actually reach that golden point of comfort and confidence. It’s not as far away as you think.”

      APPROACH
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike in the conventional approach, we make <b>using the language</b> the focal point from the beginning. You accumulate vocab and grammar progressively as you need it, rather than being bombarded with it before it is relevant. This is an <b>inductive</b> learning approach, moving from the specific to the general. So when you discover the general rule, it is immediately useful and you’re primed to grasp it easily. A tutor leads you to continually <b>work out</b> and expand your abilities (like in the gym). Your motivation is supercharged from feeling real progress.
